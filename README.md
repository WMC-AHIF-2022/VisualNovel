# Visual Novel 2.0

## Project description

This Website is all about Visual Novels.

Visual Novels are games, where the player can explore different worlds through text and pictures. In these worlds they
can make decisions, wich lead to different endings for the story.

Users are able to create their own Visual Novels and to save them on the Website.
Additionally, they can play the games that other people created and even save their game,
if they don't have the time to finish their round in one go.

To compensate for the lack of games on our website, we already have one predefined game
on the website, which can be played right away!
